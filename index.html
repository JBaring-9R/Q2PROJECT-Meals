                    <p>How to cook:
                        <br/>
                    *note:*
                        <br/>
                    -Use the right cut of meat.
                        <br/>
                    -Optional: Add pineapple juice, anise wine, or vinegar to tenderize the meat.
                        <br/>
                    Instructions:
                        <br/>
                    •---------------------------------------•
                        <br/>
                    1. In a frying pan, pour about half a cup of water on the tocino and bring it to a boil, about 2-3 minutes.
                        <br/>
                    2. Cut the tocino into sections.
                        <br/>
                    3. After cutting, drain the remaining water and put back the pan on the stove.
                        <br/>
                    4. Add a little bit of oil to the pan and lower the heat to slowly fry the tocino. Remember, patience is the key! Tocino is sweetened by sugar so you have to keep on tossing as if you’re sauteing.
                        <br/>
                    5. Fry the tocino to your liking. If you like it served on the tender side, you can turn off the heat and serve, or if you want it a bit charred with a little bit of chew, go ahead and fry it up some more.

                    <p>3. Heat oil in a wide pan. Add beef in a single layer and cook until liquid expelled from the meat is almost absorbed.</p>
                    <p>4. Add more oil and cook until the meat is lightly browned and caramelized. Remove from pan and cut into serving portions. Serve hot.</p>

                    <h6 style="color: #7E6363;">Chicken Adobo is an authentic Filipino dish and is one of the mostly recognized Filipino foods.</h6>

                <div class="flip-card-back">
                    <p>How to cook:</p>
                    <p>1. Let the chicken soak in soy sauce and crushed garlic for 1 to 12 hours, but 3 hours is usually just right for good flavor. The longer it sits, the more it soaks up the tasty sauce and garlic. You can also add vinegar during this step if you like.</p>
                    <p>2. Take the chicken out of the marinade, but don’t throw the marinade away—you’ll need it later. Cook the chicken in a pan for about 1 to 1 ½ minutes on each side to partially cook the outside. This helps make the skin stronger, so it stays together nicely when you stew it later.</p>
                    <p>3. Pour the marinade into the pot, add water, and bring it to a boil. Add the bay leaves and peppercorns, cook for 20 to 25 minutes (or longer on low heat for extra tender chicken), then mix in vinegar, sugar, and salt—just remember to taste it before adding the seasonings!</p>

                    <h6 style="color: #7E6363;">Sinigang is a sour soup that is usually cooked using pork belly, beef, shrimp, and fish.</h6>
                </div>
                <div class="flip-card-back">
                    <p>How to cook:</p>
                    <p>1. Boil the tamarind until it releases enough sourness. Afterward, strain out the solid parts using a kitchen sieve or strainer.</p>
                    <p>2. Traditional sinigang is made by boiling all ingredients together. Begin by adding the tamarind broth to a deep, wide pot. Boil the liquid and then add some onion and tomato. This will add flavor to the broth. This is also the proper time to add the pork belly (or any other meats you decided to use). Make sure to cover your pot so that the liquid can boil quickly.</p>
                    <p>3. Not all vegetables cook at the same time. This is the reason why you should add the sinigang veggies by batch. The first veggies to add are daikon radish and eggplants, along with string beans if you want them extra soft. After 5 minutes on low heat, add the long green peppers, string beans, remaining tomatoes, and okra, and cook for another 3 minutes.</p>

                    <p>How to cook:</p>
                    <p>1. Start by sautéing onion and garlic. Adding ginger is optional. Make sure that the onion softens before adding pork.</p>
                    <p>2. Grill the marinated pork belly for about 10 minutes, flipping occasionally for color. Let it cool, then chop into small pieces. Mix with 3 tbsp vinegar and 3 tbsp soy sauce for extra sour and salty flavor.</p>
                    <p>3. Set your oven to broil. In a cast iron pan, add the pork belly with all the sauce. 
                    Broil for 5 minutes or until it is CRISPY. You want a Crispy Sisig. 
                    Garnish with an egg on top, remaining onion, green onions, and red chili peppers. Add as little or as much chili to make spicy sisig.</p>

                    <p>1. In a large bowl, combine annatto oil, lemongrass, half of the red onion, smashed garlic cloves, vinegar, soy sauce, fish sauce, sugar, salt, and pepper. Rub the marinade onto the pork belly, cover, and refrigerate for 30 minutes, or overnight for better flavor.</p>
                    <p>2.Bring to a boil, then lower the heat to a simmer and braise for one hour with the lid on.</p>
                    <p>3. Check on this braise every 20 minutes and stir. Skim the fat off the top of the pot during braising. After braising for one hour, the meat should be tender and soft to the touch.</p>
                    <p>*note:* The heat from the cast iron and the meat will cook the raw egg and make a creamy sauce.</p>
